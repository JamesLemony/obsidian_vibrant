# Vibrant Theme

### I have no idea what I am doing.
Hi there! This is an extremely experimental, eye-piercing theme that I have created for my personal use. I thought that I can share this with the world and someone can find this interesting. This is not in anyway **finished**. I am sure that you can find hundreds of bugs in a second but you can let me know and we can fix them!

The pictures and the real theme that you will experience may or may not match. Please understand that maintaining this theme is not my full-time job. If you have any questions, feel free to send me a message or open up an issue. You can message me on Discord with this tag: `@jameslemony`.
